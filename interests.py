"""
A small tool to calculate the value of an investment at different interest rates in the future.

Asks the user how much money, over which time horizon and at what interest rates he wants to invest.

Args:
    (int) P - value of initial investment
    (int) r - interest rates
    (int) t - time in years
Returns:
    (int) Pt - Value of investment in the future after t years
