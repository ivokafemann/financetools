A small tool to calculate the value of an investment in the future.

Asks the user how much money and at what interest rate he wants to invest.

Args:
    (int) P - value of initial investment
    (int) r - interest rate
    (int) t - time in years
Returns:
    (int) P1 - Value of investment in the future
